All Classic and Time models supported
--------------------
Por fin en espa√±ol! TextWatch ES + Weather displays the time in natural language (Spanish-Castilian) and allows you to check the weather condition and temperature (in C or F) on a glance. 

Based primarly on [DC TextWatch Deluxe](https://github.com/wackyneighbor/DC_Text_Watch_Deluxe) by [wackyneighbor](https://github.com/wackyneighbor). I evolved it to fit my own preferences:
  * Simple
  + Clean
  * Weather Added
  * Spanish only
  * ~~Pebble Time Round only~~ All Classic and Time models suported

Devs Help
--------------------
I am not planning on giving continuity to this project, but if anyone would like to modify the code (translations and enhacements) I tagged the lines of the code that should be somehow modified with the tag TagDev. Summary of enhacements:

  * ~~Supported in square Pebbles (Classic, Steel, Time Sq)~~
  * Translation to other languages
  * Improve the response from the Config page (developed under Pebble Clay). Units updates after the main screen of the watch is restarted, not after saving settings.
  * Improve the customization: More weather providers (Yahoo based on this app), etc.
