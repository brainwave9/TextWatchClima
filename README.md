All Classic and Time models supported
--------------------

Add some weather to your TextWatch! This watchface bring the weather conditions straight to your wrist. 

Based loosely on [DC TextWatch Deluxe](https://github.com/wackyneighbor/DC_Text_Watch_Deluxe) by [wackyneighbor](https://github.com/wackyneighbor), I adjusted to my preferences:
  * Simple
  + Clean
  * Weather Conditions
  * Customizable
  * Classic, Time and Pebble 2 models suported
  * International: Select your language (Currently available: Spanish/English, possibility of translation at request)

Future Developments
--------------------
I am not planning on giving continuity to this project, but if anyone would like to modify the code (translations and enhacements) I tagged the lines of the code that should be somehow modified with the tag TagDev. Summary of enhacements:

  * Translation to other languages
  * Improve the customization: More weather providers (Yahoo based on this app), etc.
